PRIMARY

A primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your app's screens and components.
Your primary color can be used to make a color theme for your app, including dark and light primary color variants.

SECONDARY
A secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product. Having a secondary color is 
optional, and should be applied sparingly to accent select parts of your UI.
* Floating action buttons
* Selection controls, like sliders and switches
* Highlighting selected text
* Progress bars
* Links and headlines

Dark and light secondary variants
Just like the primary color, your secondary color can have dark and light variants. A color
theme can use your primary color, secondary color, and dark and light variants of each color.

Surface, background, and error colors typically don’t represent brand:

* Surface colors affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus.
* The background color appears behind scrollable content. The baseline background and surface color is #FFFFFF.
* Error color indicates errors in components, such as invalid text in a text field. The baseline error color is #B00020.
